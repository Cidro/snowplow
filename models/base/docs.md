# Snowplow Base Events
{% docs snowplow_base_events %}

An events table is one of the core models in web analytics.

An events table contains clickstream events from the marketing website.

Here is a [detailed view of the fields](https://github.com/snowplow/snowplow/wiki/Canonical-event-model#platform) that the events table provides.

The events in this table are recorded by [Snowplow](http://github.com/snowplow/snowplow) and piped into the warehouse on an hourly basis.
